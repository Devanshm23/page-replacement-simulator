# üñ•Ô∏è Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator (C++)

A **C++ simulation tool** to evaluate the performance of multiple page replacement strategies.  
This project is inspired by **Operating System memory management concepts** and demonstrates how different algorithms perform under varying workloads.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Implements **FIFO, LRU, MRU, and OPT (Optimal)** page replacement algorithms.
- Simulates **multiple processes** with configurable RAM size and process size.
- Uses **Factory Design Pattern** to dynamically create algorithm instances.
- Uses **Singleton Pattern** to manage global history and results.
- Modular **OOP-based design** (easy to add new algorithms).
- Produces detailed **hit ratio comparisons** across page sizes.
